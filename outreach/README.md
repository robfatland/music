# Introduction

I have been doing STEM outreach -- mostly freelance, mostly 5th-10th grade -- since 1995 or so. Attempt number `n + 1` to bring it all 
together into some sort of focus, here we go...

## [othermathclub](https://github.com/robfatland/othermathclub)

OMC was developed for kids who like math but are not inclined towards competition style.
The content topics stray off the beaten path of the middle school curriculum: Into probability, patterns, logic and the surprising nature of infinity 
to name a few examples.
That said, however, much of the material will be familiar to readers of accessible math as popularized by writers like Martin Gardner. 
The othermathclub achieved only mixed success in practice. 
The material was often unfamiliar to the students; and the contact time was limited to one hour-long session per week.
This meant that the students were obliged to dig in on their own; but in light of the pressures and distractions
of their lives this digging in suffered. The lesson learned (by me) is to work from a baseline schedule 
that creates continuity. The other important lesson from asking 'what worked?' is that kinesthetic activities 
should be brought in as much as possible to break the psycho-spiritual paralysis that comes from sitting immobile 
in a chair for the majority of the school day. 

Here is a summary of the content as of September 2021. Some material appears in multiple locations. 


* ***Welcome*** Jupyter notebook is the catch-all for content. It starts off with Monty Hall, some graph theory problems, and a variant of Ms. Halfway
* There is function for displaying images from the `images` folder in cells. See the main README.md file; some notebooks use it via import...
* subsections are either folders or single `.ipynb` notebooks
    * isolated topics
        * Currently under review: Capitalize the notebook name when done
        * There is a lot here that can be tidied up... so do that first...
        * ...then write it up here
            * Probability: 
            * Proof: narrative of what proof is supported by some examples, including Wilson's theorem about primes
            * Topology: Konigs, Euler graphs, clay, mobius strips, oblique ref to dimensionality via Fishing Kid problem
    * computing
    * drone bees
    * fibonacci
    * geometry
    * graphs
    * images: contains sub-folders by topic: images inlined in the notebooks
    * infinity
    * logic
    * meruprastarah
    * montecarlo
    * numbers 
    * problems has 11 `.ipynb` notebooks, problems by topic
        * Start: Some language-based problems, cube cutting, hill hike, rose-red city, egg boil (gallon type)
        * Logic: One knights and knaves problem
        * Challenging Logic: Conway's wizards, S & P & x & y, hats, paraphrase of Munroe's eye color, zebra
        * Geometry and Numbers: Tristan's competition problem, Jake's code golf
        * Paradoxes: Raven, thirsty restaurant, Hilbert hotel, joke, pointer to Wikipedia listing
        * Competition: A few example problems from competitive math, just to see what they look like
        * Misc: As the name says; includes Koch, track ants, several others
        * Aha: Counter jump, bee, 4 travellers, hole/sphere, fishing kid, chips, parole flips, dark nickels, look and say 
        * Stories: hill hike, duck wolf, halfway, 4 travellers, 4 bugs, boring worm, triangular frame, hilbert, ambiguous clock, pond rope 
        * Practical: Fast baseball plus some activities that require materials (lasers and such)
        * Graphs: Several problems stated, then `2n` vertices, `n**2+1` edges triangle problem with solution

## [pythonbytes](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes)

This is another effort at bringing extra material to Middle School students. The **othermathclub** content has a lot of 
'programmable moments'; and some of that has translated across to this repository. For example the problem of four bugs
starting at the corners of a square table and walking towards one another is a great coding problem; and lends itself 
well to a graphical display of the solution.

Inspired by **WaTOR** and **Among Us** this is an online game that you play by first writing your own Client. 
You begin as a visitor to an alien world that seems to be entirely ocean.
