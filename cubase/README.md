## Gain Staging

The goal is -12 dB on the master bus, leaving a lot of headroom in the mix. But this is not the same as -12 dB on the fader for each source channel. 

Loops and so forth; pre-built content; are by nature VERY LOUD!!! Why? Because it is a Loud World and a competition to get your attention. 

No problem: We just get accustomed to attenuating everything on import. Before you do anything else: Go to the channel strip in the mixer or 
the EQ control for the track and find the PreGain. Turn it on. Set it down from unity gain to -12dB; and go from there. 

* PreGain to -12dB
* Audio tracks: Use the pencil tool to introduce localized attenuation of hot sections: 'Much more natural sounding than a compressor'
* Audio tracks are Events or Clips; which have clip gain setting (starting at unity): Magnitude of the waveform. Use if necessary.
* Write automation: Using the fader write an envelope during playback. Attention, post: *All* the adjustable stuff, like tilt
* Not covered yet: Full work flow, EQ particularly bass, Compression, Mastering, Mix Down, returning to a loud mix if so desired.


## Scoring

The best approach I've found to date is to build a MIDI track that is intended for a score. MIDI is easy to edit and quantify. 
The MIDI feeds the Score editor, so printed music. Then mute the MIDI track and record it from a real instrument.


Sometimes we start from a keyboard part and want to decompose that into a bassline and a guitar part. I find it helpful to
duplicate the keyboard and treat the lower copy as the proto-bassline. Delete everything except the lowest note and change
the VST Instrument. Then on the upper track do the converse.


The Cubase Score Editor is a learning curve proposition. Do the learning curve before trying to create a score for a project. 
This is painful because it feels slow.
