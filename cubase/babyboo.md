## process: unpacking archaea for production

- loaded the project and it appears to contain...
    - doxology
        - 3 audio reference tracks
        - 4 MIDI tracks including tempo 180
        - 4 tracks: 2 x ( ref audio + MIDI) pairs
        - 4 reference audio: horn / bass / drums (swing counterbeat)
        - 7 Tracks of MIDI multi-voice gold
    - baby boo 6 tracks
    - 'fast' 120bpm fragments, needs a better name: pno / epno / bone / tenor etcetera: refer audio tracks off kurz; 13 tracks in total
- cleaned these up a bit, turned up the audio levels; mute all; save project...
- ***DO NOT COPY-PASTE DUPLICATE THE PROJECT*** because everything goes terribly wrong
- ***DO File > MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF THE PROJECT***
- Each time: Set up a new folder; all the audio is replicated

Now we have 3 projects: BabyBoo 2024, Doxology 2024, Fast 2024

### Baby Boo project

- MIDI > Dissolve Part > 4 instrument tracks: channels 2, 3, 4, 10 from Kurz
    - Instruments: Init Raven, Drums&Bass Kit 1, Mic'd Upright Bass, Fusion Horns ('bone)
    - Deleted the extraneous tracks so now just 4 Instrument tracks
    - Score is wrong: Tempo is wrong: Set all 4 to linear time base and modify tempo: 120 > 115
        - Score still reads "120"
    - Score still pretty terrible... created "rebuild" keyboard and bass tracks; will add trombone later
        - Idea is to recapture keys and bass to a usable score...
        - ...then create audio recordings of the parts...
        - ...where the trombone part is a departure from the basic figure:
        - Am7 Em7 D C G
