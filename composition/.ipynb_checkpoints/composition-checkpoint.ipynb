    "to say. In fact I often steal lyrics from playwrights and poets to avoid having to come up with anything original. \n",

    "First elaboration: Out In The Country. This is a song recorded by Three Dog Night that has a fantastic intro guitar\n",
    "vamp that quickly welcomes in the promising lyric \"Whenever I need to leave it all behind...\" For me the first few lines\n",
    "of Out In The Country are a great example of how quickly and easily music and singing can sweep us away into an immersive\n",
    "listening frame of mind. But this particular example -- for me -- absolutely crashes and burns a moment later by pivoting \n",
    "into a saccharine chorus with matching vacuous, sentimental lyrics; 'Out where the rivers like to run' and so forth. I \n",
    "don't fault the tune as a popular success; but it helps me articulate what I am looking for (not that!) when I'm trying \n",
    "to put a piece together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit in this narrative is the idea of a spectrum: On the one side familiarity and resolution and on the other\n",
    "in contrast tension and novelty. How the song unfolds on this spectrum is a kind of puzzle to solve; so composing a\n",
    "piece is a process of solving this problem in some idiomatic context. To belabor this a little: By idiomatic context \n",
    "I mean something like Samba or Bluegrass. More broadly a collection of songs can be seen as a metasolution of the same\n",
    "problem, like on the scale of a traditional album of seven or eight tunes. I would say my personal aversion to the\n",
    "Out In The Country chorus is a disagreement about pegging the spectrum needle to familiar and resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a second elaboration: Virtually any Yes song features iceberg lyrics that imply much more unsaid while \n",
    "evoking themes and events and emotion. As a result I experience this music as *unresolved*. I mean\n",
    "I dunno, you tell me: Did we really count to 100? The fact of this unresolution that I carry around for\n",
    "forty years and more is a different facet of engagement, what I referred to above as immersive listening.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"puzzle thinking\" and \"lyrical contribution\" are deconstructed fragments of a composing process. I think anything\n",
    "I try and write about composing is going to come down to a bucket of fragments. Here is another: A particular Hungarian\n",
    "mathematician was famously both an atheist and an appreciator of beauty in mathematical proofs. The most striking\n",
    "and elegant of these are written by God in a book called The Book, he would say. And his point was that one does not \n",
    "necessarily need to believe in God but one *should* believe in *The Book*. In my view every piece of music we have ever\n",
    "performed or tried to perform is a momentary decoration of time. We can choose to apply a similar aesthetic in \n",
    "appreciation. As a starting point all music has merit, has value. When the song ends and supposing we understand \n",
    "time as a decorated structure: We might say that the decoration is not with\n",
    "us at the moment; but persists. I'd like to imagine it has gone into the wind.\n",

    "A sequencer is very useful for experimentation from a baseline track, for example a chord sequence or an\n",

    "a piano one can try out a horn, a flute, an oboe, and a clarinet. In contrast the problem with recording a live\n",

    "Early on in my history of composition -- about 1990 -- I was working on a piece called \"Look Up\"\n",
    "which had two distinct melodic lines. Cramming two or more songs worth of music into a single piece\n",
    "has been a recurring theme. Anyway at some point I managed to record one theme and as I was playing\n",
    "it back I found I could play the second theme over it. This helped to demystify the idea that\n",
    "songs are somehow hermetic creations that spring to life fully formed according to formal and\n",
    "highly restrictive laws of harmony. (More fractal pressure, in other words.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This realization that lines can be mixed has a recurring value. A bassline can be thought of as\n",

    "Given some piece of scaffolding for a song, let's say a chord sequence, I found that other \n",
    "songs or themes can often be stretched across it in an interesting way. Without breaking anything. \n",
    "As an example back around 1999 I was working on a Christmas-themed tune called SleiBellz. \n",
    "The song directly quotes the familiar (and fairly complicated) Christmas tune \"Sleigh Ride\". My\n",
    "composition runs pretty long, about 7 minutes, as it evolves through multiple phases with occasional \n",
    "callbacks. At one point in the progression I was playing a phrase on the piano based on A-minor.\n",
    "Since the song is a wry reflection on Christmas music I thought to try playing Jingle Bells starting\n",
    "with this A-minor chord; and to my surprise this was perfectly feasible with a little\n",
    "flex in rhythm and voicing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So there is a lot more latitude in putting a piece together because the interpretation happens \n",
    "through the mind of the listener. That's where this leads: To respect for the human mind as it\n",
