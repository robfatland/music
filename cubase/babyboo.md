# baby boo

## notes on process: unpacking archaea for production

- loaded the project and it appears to contain...
    - doxology
        - 3 audio reference tracks
        - 4 MIDI tracks including tempo 180
        - 4 tracks: 2 x ( ref audio + MIDI) pairs
        - 4 reference audio: horn / bass / drums (swing counterbeat)
        - 7 Tracks of MIDI multi-voice gold
    - baby boo 6 tracks
    - 'fast' 120bpm fragments, needs a better name: pno / epno / bone / tenor etcetera: refer audio tracks off kurz; 13 tracks in total
  - cleaned these up a bit, turned up the audio levels; mute all; save project...
      - ***DO NOT COPY-PASTE DUPLICATE THE PROJECT*** because everything goes terribly wrong
      - ***DO File > MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF THE PROJECT***
      - Each time: Set up a new folder; now all the audio is replicated
