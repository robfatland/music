# Introduction

I have been doing STEM outreach -- mostly freelance, mostly 5th-10th grade -- since 1995 or so. Attempt number `n + 1` to bring it all 
together into some sort of focus, here we go...

* othermathclub
   * for kids who like math but are not inclined towards competition style
   * intended to go off the beaten track of the curriculum
   * ***Welcome*** Jupyter notebook is the catch-all for content. It starts off with Monty Hall, some graph theory problems, and a variant of Ms. Halfway
   * There is function for displaying images from the `images` folder in cells. See the main README.md file; some notebooks use it via import...
   * subsections
       * appendices
           * Activities and Lectures 
           * book ideas: Really is notes on writing a book
           * e to the x
           * infinite series
           * leech trees (note redundancy with I think Welcome.ipynb)
       * computing
       * drone bees
       * fibonacci
       * geometry
       * graphs
       * images: sub-folders by topic, contain images that are inlined in the notebooks
       * infinity
       * logic
       * meruprastarah
       * montecarlo
       * numbers 
       * probability
       * problems
       * proof
       * topology
