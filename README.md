    * To inline images follow this procedure
        * Create `README.md` in a sub-folder called `cbs-topic-name-here-static` and copy contents in from `README.md` in `cbs-jupyter-static` 
        * Upload images to this folder
        * Create image inline markdown in `cbs-topic-name-here.md` as shown below

* Can use `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt`
    * The latter is associated with `pip install` and can be made a sub-component of the former
    * `environment.yml` as follows
        * `conda env export` produces `environment.yml`
    * `requirements.txt` as follows
        * Create a virtual environment `python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/env`
        * Install packages using `pip install <package>`
        * Save all packages `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
        * "Pin all the package versions"... not sure what the action is or what this means
        * Move `requirements.txt` to the root directory of the project
