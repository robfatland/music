### Blackmouth


* From the [blackmouth fishing page](http://salmonuniversity.com/archives/444) at [salmon university](http://salmonuniversity.com)
  * blackmouth == juvenile chinook; season runs to Sunday March 31
    * 5 - 15 pound fish < herring, candle fish, squid(?) near the bottom in 50 -- 150 feet 
    * 22" minimum; spots on upper and lower tail; big spots on back; dark mouth; black gums; large sharp teeth
    * hatchery only, no wild; check for the healed scar of a clipped adipose fin
  * fishing
    * San Juans recommended, good locations for both flood and ebb; ideally moderate slack tides
    * Recommending 2 - 2.5 mph SOG with the current as chinook are active pursuit fish
    * Flasher and spoon or flasher and hoochie have been the go to technique on the troll
    * Downrigger trolling... to flasher to bait (scent) to single barbless
      * Near the bottom; 'not afraid' to make contact with downrigger weights fairly often
      * 10 - 20 feet off the bottom, 20-30 degree angle on the wire recommended
      * bigger fish are below the 'shakers' (immature / too small)
      * Suggested:

above downrigger ball
    * flasher

with lights ($$$), electrical signals...
      * Anecdotal support for smaller 8 inch flashers
      * Line-twist with spoon-and-flasher: Size 3 Sampo or Berkley ball-bearing swivel in-line a foot above the flasher 
    * lure
      * downrigger -- 15 feet -- 11" ProTroll flasher -- 26 -- 36" leader -- spoon + scent + garlic powder

3.5" or 4" spoon also from Silver Horde
      * Calamari plugs (?) 10 feet higher than above; no flasher; 40 feet behind the downrigger
      * Replace King Fisher spoon with the “Tail Wagger” Hoochie Hook with #15 Octopus Squid Skirt on the hook
to slow spoon action at a faster trolling speed.
      * Needlefish Hoochie or Needlefish Ace-Hi Fly in a green spatter back finish. 
        * With tandem-tied 4/0 Owner SSW Cutting Point hooks 32 inches behind an 11-inch flasher
      * bait: particularly green-label / plug-cut herring
        * tandem-tied 3/0 or 3/0-4/0 Owner Cutting Point hooks tied on 20-pound monofilament leader material.       
        * 7- to 9-foot leader with a Sampo or Penn ball-bearing swivel in the middle and a No. 5 barrel swivel at the top end
          * for quick connection to the ball-bearing swivel and Duo-Lock snap at the end of his main line
        * Another plug cut green-label style is...
          * 2 Mustad UltraPoint hooks so that it spins in a tight circle even at slow speed. 
          * 3/0 hook in front and a 2/0 in back. 
          * A six-foot leader of Berkley Big Game UltraClear or 15-pound fluorocarbon runs to...
          * a swivel that connects leader to main line
          * six-bead swivel chains 
          * if 2 or 3 become tangled with grass the others will continue to work and reduce or eliminate line twist
          * Snap line into downrigger release about 25 feet behind the ball (seems to be no-flasher)
          * fish with the current five to 10 feet off the bottom whenever and wherever possible 
        * 3.5-inch or 4-inch Coyote Spoon 
          * chartreuse/fish-scale finish (color #0580) behind an 11-inch Pro-Troll HotChip Flasher in Green Stryper
          * About 42 inches of 30-pound Berkley Big Game UltraClear monofilament to flasher
          * little Smelly Jelly (usually herring or anchovy scent on the concave (chrome) side of the spoon
          * ...and a little more near the tail end of the flasher.
    * hooks (check if double hooks are ok)
      * [This article](http://salmonuniversity.com/archives/3736) is interesting
      * Sharp sharp shar: Three-sided point, use sharpener, inspect hooks always
      * Single: Matsuo sickle hooks recommended
      * Pair of singles: Mustad’s 92553 octopus hook
        * Top hook right behind the head of the bait or lure
        * Bottom hook slightly behind the tail end of the lure
  * mooching 
    * Green or red label herring, plug cut, on a 3/0 – 2/0 Gamakatsu octopus hooks, light 20lb leader 6'
      * Extra bit of spin on the light leader and small hooks. 
      * Catching at or near the bottom both on the drop and also the retrieve...
        * ...but we have caught many fish near the surface so fish throughout the entire water column      



### Landed


- stun and bleed (scissors or knife on both gill sets) 
- fish just under the water along side; do not troll for seals; 15 minutes; cool fish box (ice) until ready to clean
  - Clean pinks / humpies immediately and pack in ice
- End of the fishing day clean the fish whole or fillet it
- Place in a sealed fish bag packed in ice for trip home
- At home: trim the fish up, re-wash; and either eat it within a day or vacuum pack it and freeze it to smoke later
