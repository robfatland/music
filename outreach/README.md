# Introduction

I have been doing STEM outreach -- mostly freelance, mostly 5th-10th grade -- since 1995 or so. Attempt number `n + 1` to bring it all 
together into some sort of focus, here we go...

* othermathclub
   * for kids who like math but are not inclined towards competition style
   * intended to go off the beaten track of the curriculum
   * ***Welcome*** Jupyter notebook is the catch-all for content. It starts off with Monty Hall, some graph theory problems, and a variant of Ms. Halfway
   * There is function for displaying images from the `images` folder in cells. See the main README.md file; some notebooks use it via import...
   * subsections are either folders or single `.ipynb` notebooks
       * appendices
           * Activities and Lectures 
           * book ideas: Really is notes on writing a book
           * e to the x
           * infinite series
           * leech trees (note redundancy with I think Welcome.ipynb)
           * evolution lexicon
           * meru ideas
           * pencil moving templates???
           * pft
           * radicals
           * rainbows
           * ring
           * sixes
           * steiner
           * activities and lectures
           * minecraft
           * notes
           * oz
           * plateau
           * solutions
       * computing
       * drone bees
       * fibonacci
       * geometry
       * graphs
       * images: contains sub-folders by topic: images inlined in the notebooks
       * infinity
       * logic
       * meruprastarah
       * montecarlo
       * numbers 
       * probability
       * problems has 11 `.ipynb` notebooks featuring problems by topic
           * Start: Some language-based problems, cube cutting, hill hike, rose-red city, egg boil (gallon type)
           * Logic: One knights and knaves problem
           * Challenging Logic: Conway's wizards, S & P & x & y, hats, paraphrase of Munroe's eye color, zebra
           * Geometry and Numbers: Tristan's competition problem, Jake's code golf
           * Paradoxes: Raven, thirsty restaurant, Hilbert hotel, joke, pointer to Wikipedia listing
           * Competition: A few example problems from competitive math, just to see what they look like
           * Misc: As the name says; includes Koch, track ants, several others
           * Aha: Counter jump, bee, 4 travellers, hole/sphere, fishing kid, chips, parole flips, dark nickels, look and say 
           * Stories: hill hike, duck wolf, halfway, 4 travellers, 4 bugs, boring worm, triangular frame, hilbert, ambiguous clock, pond rope 
           * Practical: Fast baseball plus some activities that require materials (lasers and such)
           * Graphs: Several problems stated, then `2n` vertices, `n**2+1` edges triangle problem with solution
       * proof: narrative of what proof is supported by some examples, including Wilson's theorem about primes
       * topology: Konigs, Euler graphs, clay, mobius strips, oblique ref to dimensionality via Fishing Kid problem
